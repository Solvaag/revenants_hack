# Character Creation

You have six abilities; Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. For each ability, roll 3d6 and sum the number together. 

On your character sheet, note down each sum in the cell next to the label. Your ability score also determines what you need to roll equal to or higher when asked to make checks or saves. See the table below:

| Ability Score | Modifier | Easy | Challenging | Hard | Save |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 - 4 | -2 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 16 |
| 5 - 8 | -1 | 8 | 13 | 19 | 14 |
| 9 - 12 | - | 6 | 11 | 18 | 12 |
| 13 - 16 | +1 | 4 | 9 | 17 | 10 |
| 17 - 20 | +2 | 3 | 7 | 16 | 8 |

* Modifiers are only used in certain occasions. 

Your **Grit** and your **Luck** are equal to your Constitution.

On your character sheet, you have a section with two attack types listed. Using your abilities, consult the following chart. For melee attacks, use your Strength value, and for ranged attacks use your Wisdom value:

| Ability Score	| Unarmored |	Leather |	Chain	| Plate |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| 1 - 4 |	12 |	15 | 17 | 20 |
| 5 - 8 | 10 | 13 | 15 | 19 |
| 9 - 12 | 8 | 11 | 13 | 18 |
| 13 - 16 | 5 | 8 | 10 | 17 |
| 17 - 20 |	3 | 6 | 8 | 16 |

# Advancing your Abilities
You learn by doing. After making a certain amount of checks, your Ability advances by +1 once you get a nightâ€™s rest in a safe haven. 

How many checks you need to advance an Ability depends on your current Ability value. You need to have a certain amount of easy, challenging and hard checks made before you can advance. Consult the following table for an overview:

| Ability Score | Easy | Challenging | Hard |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
|4 | 2| 1 |1 |
|5 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
|6 | 2 | 2 | 1| 
|7 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
|8| 3|2|2|
|9| 3|2|2|
|10|3|3|2|
|11|3|3|2|
|12|4|3|2|
|13|4|3|2|
| 14|4|3|2|
|15|4|4|2|
|16|5|4|3|
|17|5|4|3|
|18|5|4|3|

Once your ability rises to a value of its original value + 4 or 18 (whichever is lowest), it cannot advance any further. 

# Inventory
In this game, characters are assumed to have two hands (1 slot each, up to 4 combined), two fast access slots and ten backpack slots. Many items fit within just one slot, such as a small book, a light weapon, a hip flask or a pack of bullets. Some items can be oversized and take up more than just one slot, such as suits of armor or  two-handed weapons. Generally, a slot can one or multiples of the same thing at a total weight of 5 lbs or less. Items that are bulky do not fit in item slots and can only be carried using both hands.
