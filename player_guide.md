# Character Creation

You have six abilities; Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. For each ability, roll 3d6 and sum the number together. 

On your character sheet, note down each sum in the cell next to the label. Your ability score also determines what you need to roll equal to or higher when asked to make checks or saves. See the table below:

| Ability Score | Modifier | Easy | Challenging | Hard | Save |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 - 4 | -2 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 16 |
| 5 - 8 | -1 | 8 | 13 | 19 | 14 |
| 9 - 12 | - | 6 | 11 | 18 | 12 |
| 13 - 16 | +1 | 4 | 9 | 17 | 10 |
| 17 - 20 | +2 | 3 | 7 | 16 | 8 |

* Modifiers are only used in certain occasions. 

Your **Grit** is equal to your Constitution.

On your character sheet, you have a section with two attack types listed. Using your abilities, consult the following chart. For melee attacks, use your Strength value, and for ranged attacks use your Wisdom value:

| Ability Score	| Unarmored |	Leather |	Chain	| Plate |
