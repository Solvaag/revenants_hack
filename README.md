# Welcome to the Revenant's Hack

Hello and welcome to the git repository for the Revenant's Hack. Here you can find a ruleset written in the style of Dungeons & Dragons, but with many alterations made to simplify play. The game is compatible with old school D&D material, as well as many newer products such as Old School Renaissance/Revival publications. 

If you like what you read here, please visit my blog [Revenant's Quill](https://www.revenant-quill.com/).
