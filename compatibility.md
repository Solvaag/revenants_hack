Content Conversion
The following section aims to assist the referee in using content both old and new to play. 

Monsters
Monsters from games like Dungeons & Dragons B/X and similar old school games or OSR products can be used with a little conversion. 

Hit Dice or Hit Points  form two values in Revenant’s Hack. If the monster entry has hit dice indicated, multiply that value with 4 to find its Max Luck. If the monster entry has only hit points indicated, divide that value by half to find its Max Luck and by 8 to find its Hit Dice.  A monster that suffers an amount of Strain equal to its Hit dice is slain. 

Armor Class is converted to a specific Armor Type in Revenant’s Hack. If the system is using ascending AC, simply confer to the table below to find its type. If the system is using descending AC, subtract that value from 20 and confer to the table below.

Attack Bonuses or similar concepts such as Base Attack Bonus, simply refer to the table below. If the monster entry has no such values, simply use the monster’s Hit Dice instead to find its attack values against the different armor types.

In case the monster entry has no Morale value, simply roll 3d6 and discard the highest die - the result is the monster’s Morale for that encounter. 
Old school saving throws

In case the Saving Throws section was not sufficient to determine which ability to use, the following points can also be used as guidelines:
Constitution saves for Death saves. 
Intelligence saves for Wands saves. 
Dexterity saves for Paralysis and Breath saves. 
Wisdom saves for Spells saves.
