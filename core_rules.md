# Abilities

## Checks
Whenever a character attempts to do something important that has a chance of failure, the character performs a check.To succeed a check, you roll a d20. If the number is equal to or higher than the value indicated in the difficulty column of your check, your check succeeds. NOTE: Regardless if you succeed or fail, be sure to make a tally mark in your character sheet on the same line as the ability you used! 

It’s the referee’s discretion what a given check’s difficulty might be. In general, you can receive aid by allies to lower a difficulty by one. If multiple dangers influence your check, such as an enemy firing arrows at you, and your hands are slippery while trying to climb a rope, the difficulty might just increase. 

You use your … when ... :
* **Strength** for melee attacks, athletics and tasks such as lifting, pushing or pulling things.  
* **Dexterity** for acrobatics, agility and finesse tasks, such as sneaking, tumbling and dodging.
* **Constitution** for tasks that involve endurance, such as working in cold or hot environments, lack of sleep and marching long distances.
* **Intelligence** for tasks that require acuity, concentration or precision, such as working magic, applying knowledge and education, pick-pocketing or working complex machinery.
* **Wisdom** for ranged attacks, tasks that require perception, intuition or spiritual connections, such as tracking, searching and sensing spirits or ghosts. 
* **Charisma** for tasks that require social interaction with NPCs and monsters, be it talking yourself into or out of trouble, flattery and threats. 

## Saving Throws
If a character is put into a dangerous situation or a harmful effect comes its way, you must make a saving throw. The referee declares which Ability you must save with. For your saving throw to succeed, you have to roll a d20 equal to or greater than the Save value  indicated on your character’s Ability row. 

Use the following guidelines for what ability to use for a saving throw:
* **Strength** against physical harm that cannot be dodged.
* **Dexterity** against physical harm that can be dodged.
* **Constitution** against poisons, diseases and death effects. 
* **Intelligence** against spells and magic.
* **Wisdom** against deceptions and illusions.
* **Charisma** against charming effects. 

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes your character gains an edge or set back, be it from a spell, circumstance or special ability. These rules might confer advantage to your checks and saves, which lets you roll 2d20 and pick the highest one for your result. Similarly, some situations may cause you to have disadvantage to checks and saves, in which you must roll 2d20 and pick the lowest of the two for your result. For each source that gives you advantage, you may cancel one source of disadvantage for a given round. 

# Luck, Strain and Damage
In Revenant’s Hack, Luck represents a mix of morale, grace and, well, luck!  When in dangerous encounters and dealing with hazards, damage dealt to you lowers your Current Luck, while more serious events such as close calls with death can change your Max Luck. Your Current Luck cannot be higher than your Max Luck, and whenever you are said to regain Luck, it is your Current Luck you adjust. If your Current Luck reaches 0, you fall unconscious at the end of the following round. 

Strain represents lasting effects on your character’s health and endurance. Strain starts at 0 and increases whenever you suffer serious damage. At the end of any encounter or escape from a hazard, if you have suffered Strain and you are unconscious, you must roll on the “Out of Luck” table in the “Death & Luck” section.  

Damage in Revenant’s Hack represents the potential to sustain injury. Whenever you suffer damage, you must compare the  amount of damage to your Current Luck or Shield, whichever is highest. If the damage amount is higher, then you suffer 1 Strain. Otherwise, your Current Luck is reduced by 1. Current Luck cannot be reduced below 0, so any further reduction to Current Luck counts as 1 Strain instead. 

# Rest

You have an amount of **Rest Points** equal to twice your Constitution. 

You can spend 1 Rest Point as part of a for every 10 minutes spent, either eating, drinking or relaxing. For each Rest Point you spend this way, you regain 1 Current Luck, or for every 4 Rest Points you spend, you can reduce 1 Strain.

If you eat a meal and get a full night’s rest, you regain half of your spent Rest Points. 

If you rest in a safe haven  you regain all your Rest Points and your Current Luck is set to your Max Luck. In addition, a night’s rest in a safe haven reduces 1 Strain. 

# Encounters
## Reactions
Other creatures, especially humans, vary more in the way they react to encountering the player characters. Some may be allies disguised as the enemy, while others might not have any ill will. In cases when it is not obvious how the creatures involved in the encounter would act, the Referee should roll on the following table with 2d6:

|2d6 |Result|
|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | Hostile |
|3 - 5| Unfriendly |
| 6 - 8 | Neutral |
| 9 - 11 | Civil |
| 12 | Friendly |

## Initiative
Take two sets of tokens, one of each color. One color belongs to the GM, while the other belongs to the players. Then, grab a bowl or a bag to put these tokens in and call it the pool. 

For each player, add one player-token to the pool. For every four hireling, add one player-token. Then, for every enemy leader, add one GM-token, and for every four enemy minion, add one GM-token. 

Once a round start, take turns around the table to pick one token from the pool. The color indicates who gets to act - the GM or one of the Players. The player who picks up the token is free to pass it on to any other player if so desired. The GM does not pick up tokens, but rather lets the players do it for him/her. 

A token lets you activate a player character, and one hireling within 15 ft per bonus you have in Charisma. Activated creatures can move up to their speed, and at any point during their movement they may perform a single combat action. 

Any creatures not activated after all tokens are spent will activate at the end of the round. 

## Combat Actions

A combat action can be casting a spell, a second move, an attack, stunt or anything that could reasonably be done within 6 seconds. In addition to a combat action, you can move up to your full combat speed (20 feet).

To make an attack, first determine who is within striking range. Next, determine the best defense type of the targets in striking range. There are four defense types; Unarmored, Leather, Chain and Plate. Each of these should be noted on your character sheet. You use your Strength for melee attacks and Wisdom for ranged attacks. To gain a **hit**, you make an attack roll using a d20. If the number is equal to or higher than the value indicated for the defense type. If you roll lower, you deal a **graze** instead. 

To determine the damage of your attack, make a **damage roll** using the die indicated in the description of your weapon, or one die size lower if the attack was a graze. The damage indicated of your damage roll is dealt to the target you made the attack roll against. 

Striking range for melee weapons is usually a radius of 5 ft from your character’s position, while for most ranged weapons it is either a line or cone (10 feet at its broadest) that is 120 ft long. Creatures only have to be partially within the striking range to suffer damage. 

As a general rule, you deal at least 1 damage to every target inside your striking range. Even if you do not take the attack action, you can still deal this damage. 

When you make an Attack action, you have some options available to you. In the above illustration, these options are arranged along the “attack pentagon”. You can pick one option, and one neighbor of that option. I.e.  if you pick Speed, then you can pick either Reach or Multiple targets in addition. The options effects are as follows:
* Damage boost - Increase the damage die of your weapon by one size step. 
* Accuracy - Your attack gains Advantage or you can pick a specific target to deal damage to.
* Reach - Double the length of your striking range. 
* Speed - You gain 20 ft extra combat speed for this round. If you hit an enemy, remove one of their tokens from the pool (see Initiative section). 
* Multiple targets - The effect of your damage roll applies to all targets in striking range. 

Attacks made with ranged weapons expend ammunition. Be sure to note each piece of ammunition spent. 

If you *Dodge*, enemies must roll with **disadvantage** on attacks against you. Damage rolls against you must reduce their die by one size. These effects last until the beginning of your next round. At any point during the turn, even before your round, you can immediately forgo the benefits of the Dodge action to move 20 ft. 

If you *Aim* in the turn before a ranged attack, pick a single target in striking range. On the following round, if the target remained in striking range, treat it as the only target in striking range. If you hit, you deal two damage rolls to it. If you rolled a natural 20 on the attack roll, the target must make a Dexterity save or die instantly. 

If you perform *Stunt*, such as shoving, disarming or stunning, make an attack roll to a single target in striking range using a d20. If you hit, the target suffers the effects of the stunt. Stunts don’t normally deal damage, but can do so indirectly. You can optionally cause a problem for the target, but they can make a saving throw to avoid the effect.  See “Problems” section.
