# Abilities

## Checks
Whenever a character attempts to do something important that has a chance of failure, the character performs a check.To succeed a check, you roll a d20. If the number is equal to or higher than the value indicated in the difficulty column of your check, your check succeeds. NOTE: Regardless if you succeed or fail, be sure to make a tally mark in your character sheet on the same line as the ability you used! 

It’s the referee’s discretion what a given check’s difficulty might be. In general, you can receive aid by allies to lower a difficulty by one. If multiple dangers influence your check, such as an enemy firing arrows at you, and your hands are slippery while trying to climb a rope, the difficulty might just increase. 

You use your … when ... :
* **Strength** for melee attacks, athletics and tasks such as lifting, pushing or pulling things.  
* **Dexterity** for acrobatics, agility and finesse tasks, such as sneaking, tumbling and dodging.
* **Constitution** for tasks that involve endurance, such as working in cold or hot environments, lack of sleep and marching long distances.
* **Intelligence** for tasks that require acuity, concentration or precision, such as working magic, applying knowledge and education, pick-pocketing or working complex machinery.
* **Wisdom** for ranged attacks, tasks that require perception, intuition or spiritual connections, such as tracking, searching and sensing spirits or ghosts. 
* **Charisma** for tasks that require social interaction with NPCs and monsters, be it talking yourself into or out of trouble, flattery and threats. 

## Saving Throws
If a character is put into a dangerous situation or a harmful effect comes its way, you must make a saving throw. The referee declares which Ability you must save with. For your saving throw to succeed, you have to roll a d20 equal to or greater than the Save value  indicated on your character’s Ability row. 

Use the following guidelines for what ability to use for a saving throw:
* **Strength** against physical harm that cannot be dodged.
* **Dexterity** against physical harm that can be dodged.
* **Constitution** against poisons, diseases and death effects. 
* **Intelligence** against spells and magic.
* **Wisdom** against deceptions and illusions.
* **Charisma** against charming effects. 

# Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes your character gains an edge or set back, be it from a spell, circumstance or special ability. These rules might confer advantage to your checks and saves, which lets you roll 2d20 and pick the highest one for your result. Similarly, some situations may cause you to have disadvantage to checks and saves, in which you must roll 2d20 and pick the lowest of the two for your result. For each source that gives you advantage, you may cancel one source of disadvantage for a given round.
